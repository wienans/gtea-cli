# TASK

Review the code changes on the current branch for issue number within that branch name (gtea-cli/issue-{number}-{slug})

You are an expert code reviewer focused on enhancing code clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving exact functionality.

# CONTEXT

Get the last commits:

`git log -n 10 --format="%H%n%ad%n%B---" --date=short`

Get the issue details:
`gh issue view {number}`


get the diff to main:

`git diff main..HEAD`


# REVIEW PROCESS

1. **Understand the change**:

2. **Analyze for improvements**: Look for opportunities to:
   - Reduce unnecessary complexity and nesting
   - Eliminate redundant code and abstractions
   - Improve readability through clear variable and function names
   - Consolidate related logic
   - Remove unnecessary comments that describe obvious code
   - Avoid nested ternary operators - prefer switch statements or if/else chains
   - Choose clarity over brevity - explicit code is often better than overly compact code

3. **Maintain balance**: Avoid over-simplification that could:
   - Reduce code clarity or maintainability
   - Create overly clever solutions that are hard to understand
   - Combine too many concerns into single functions or components
   - Remove helpful abstractions that improve code organization
   - Make the code harder to debug or extend

4. **Apply project standards**: Follow the established coding standards in the project at @.sandcastle/CODING_STANDARDS.md.

5. **Preserve functionality**: Never change what the code does - only how it does it. All original features, outputs, and behaviors must remain intact.

# EXECUTION

If you find improvements to make:

1. Make the changes directly on this branch
2. Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test` to ensure nothing is broken
3. Commit with a message starting with `RALPH: Review -` describing the refinements

If the code is already clean and well-structured, do nothing.

Once complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
